Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Overview 
**Background and Purpose**
In order to offer a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers at Accountability Accounting, we are tasked to create a report that has what cryptocurrencies are currently being offered on the trading market and how to create a classification system using Unsupervised Machine Learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we are using the clustering algorithm.

Specifically we are creating: 
- Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
